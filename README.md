# COVID-19 Regression Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies regression analysis to COVID-19 data, predicting trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Various regression models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Ridge Regression, are used to analyze the pandemic's progression.

## Dataset
- **Source:** COVID-19 dataset (e.g., John Hopkins University, Kaggle, or WHO data)
- **Attributes:**
  - Date
  - Confirmed Cases (Cumulative)
  - Deaths (Cumulative)
  - Recoveries (Cumulative)
  - Other relevant features (e.g., country, population, testing rates)

## Requirements
To run the project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset using Pandas
- Convert date column to datetime format
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Extract cumulative counts for cases, deaths, and recoveries

## Regression Models Implemented
- **Linear Regression:** Establishes a linear relationship between time and cumulative counts.
- **Polynomial Regression:** Captures non-linearity in the trend.
- **Ridge Regression:** Reduces overfitting in the model using L2 regularization.

## Implementation
The main steps include:
1. Loading and cleaning the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
3. Feature engineering and transformation
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Performance comparison using RÂ² score, RMSE, and MAE

## Results & Visualizations
- Time series plots of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries
- Regression model performance comparison
- Forecasting future trends based on trained models

## Future Work
- Implement more advanced models (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA)
- Incorporate external factors such as lockdown measures and vaccination rates
- Deploy the model as an interactive dashboard
